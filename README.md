# Ask a Beginner Coder

## Description

In this wwbpage I created a very basic coding quiz, fit with the ability to store scores, and leave your initials. It is timed for 1 minutes and you will lose 10 seconds of time for each wrong answer.
Apologies for the presentability, function was the purpose of this pages creation.
